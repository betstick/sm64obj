# sm64obj
OBJ Import Export for SM64PC/SM64EX source code

currently it only can export from SM64 source code to OBJ. No texture/UV support yet. Just meshes. To use, put a file in the same dir as the script, call it example4.c and then run the python script. It'll output a bunch of text. Copy paste this text into a file and save it as filename.obj. From there you can import it into Blender.

Only tested on Blender.

SM64 code has to be gotten using a legal ROM and the SM64PC/EX compiling process.
